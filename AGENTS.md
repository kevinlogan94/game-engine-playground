# Agent guidelines

Rules for work in this repo. Prefer these over default habits unless the user says otherwise.

## Prefer little code

When planning or implementing, meet the acceptance criteria in as little code as possible. Avoid speculative abstractions, extra layers, and “just in case” structure.

## Keep code simple

Favor straightforward, readable changes. Do not over-engineer. Match existing patterns in the project you are editing.

## No unit tests by default

Do not add unit tests unless the user asks for them.

## No backwards compatibility by default

Do not preserve backwards compatibility unless the user asks for it. Prefer the cleanest current solution over compatibility shims.
